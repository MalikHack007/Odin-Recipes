    <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
    <p>
        A cheeseburger is a classic American dish consisting of a grilled or fried beef patty, typically seasoned and served in a sliced bun. What sets the cheeseburger apart is the addition of melted cheese, usually placed atop the patty, adding a savory and gooey texture to the ensemble. Often garnished with various condiments such as lettuce, tomato, and pickles, the cheeseburger is a beloved and customizable culinary delight enjoyed worldwide.

    <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Patties: Separate the beef into 4 equal portions, or 8 if making double cheeseburgers (do it!). Gently roll each portion into balls then press down into round patties that are slightly larger than your bun to allow for shrinkage (12 cm / 4.7" wide, 1 cm / 0.4" thick for a 10cm / 4" burger bun).</li>
        <li>Prepare: Get all your burger bits and pieces out and ready to use. Don't salt your beef until just before cooking (it toughens the meat).</li>
        <li>Toast buns: Preheat the grill to high. Place the bread cut face up on a tray and toast for 3 to 5 minutes until light golden. (If using BBQ, place cut face down on the grill). Set aside.</li>
        <li>Dent patty: Sprinkle one side of patties with half the salt and pepper. Flip, then press a dent into the middle of each patty. (Prevents patties doming when cooking and reduces shrinkage!). Sprinkle this dented side with the remaining salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Preheat 1 tablespoon oil in a large cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot – smoking hot!</li>
        <li>Cook: Cook 2 to 4 patties (whatever fits in the pan) for 1 1/2 minutes. Press down lightly with a spatula (not too hard else the meat juices squeeze out!). Flip, then immediately top with a slice of cheese. Cook for another 1 1/2 minutes (cheese will melt by itself!) then transfer burgers to a tray to rest for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slather the base of the bun with your sauce of choice. My order of assembly: lettuce, tomato, burger (x 2 for double!), gherkins, onion, sauce on bun lid, jam it on top of the stack.</li>
        <li>DEVOUR with French Fries on the side.</li>
    </ol>
